# Switch
Introducing SWITCH: A simple and colorful 2D platformer? I guess it’s a platformer.
The game will feature a random floating square that represents the player.
The basic rules are simple (i hope). The color of the square will be the opposite of the color of the background it is currently on top of. 
If the square wants to move to another color background, it must be the color of the square at the moment. 
For example: you are on a green background, meaning your square is currently red. You can only move to a red background, which will SWITCH (get it?) your square’s color to green.
White represents the starting and end points. These are safe to move to no matter what color you currently are.
Black represents dead land  - switching to this background even if you are currently white will only hurt you.
Move to a black background or another color you cannot correctly switch to, and you will start shrinking. 
If you get small enough, you will dissapear and have to restart the level.
There will be special color gates that will make you invincible for a very short time, but then forcibly switch you to a different color. Get to appropriate background or it could mean game over!
These are the only specific rules that you absolutely need to know.
There might be special objects, like moving backgrounds, disappearing backgrounds, powerups, powerdowns, etc. But you will learn of these on your own.
